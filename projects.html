                    alt="Image of student playing with Happy Caterpiller game at the MPC STEAM exhibit."><i>Happy
                    Caterpillar</i> was our exhibit for the STEAM competition and STEM Family Day. The game is a
                recreation of the game <i>Snake</i> running on an Arduino microcontroller and displayed on a strip
                of
                NeoPixel LEDs. The cabinet was designed and painted in-house. To create the defined blocky look, a
                custom grid was 3D-printed and laid on top of the LED strips. For our efforts, we were voted as the
                favorite exhibit of the show and helped invigorate many people's enthusiasm for STEM.<br><br></p>
